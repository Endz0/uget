uGet 1.9.0 (devel)
1. Drop GTK+2, I suggest use uGet with GTK 3.4+. (avoid some GTK3 bugs)
2. Avoid crash when user delete tasks and uGet run with GTK3. (GTK3 bug?)
3. Add Commandline Settings for some FlashGot users.
4. Add setting option 'Apply recently download settings'.

Some users want to use uGet with FlashGot quietly. In the old nGet you
must add uGet as new download manager and set commandline arguments in
FlashGot. Now the new Commandline Settings is a easy way to do this.

uGet apply download settings from category by default but some users
want to use recently download settings when creating new download.
The new option 'Apply recently download settings' is for this case.
Note: The recently download settings will be discard when you quit uGet.

How to disable uGet AppIndicator support:
Search <AppIndicator value='1'/> in $HOME/.config/uGet/Setting.xml
and set value='0' to disable AppIndicator. This is function is for
Ubuntu GNOME users who want to use original tray icon logic.
