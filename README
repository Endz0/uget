uGet 1.7.0 (developing)

This version requires GTK+ version 2.18+

What's new since 1.6.x:
For user:
1. You can see new icons and "Active" subcategory.
2. It also can refresh progress more fast than 1.6.
3. Program will rename config directory from "Uget" to "uGet" automatically.
4. Program can change tray icon if an error occurred or downloading start.

For developer:
1. The UgCategory becomes a independent structure and removes watch and dispatch functions.
2. New UgRunning is a group contains all running jobs, all watch and dispatch functions move to here.
3. New UgDataLog is used for log. It only has two members currently.
4. I implement a simple average speed limit in ug_running_do_speed_limit(). I hope anyone can improve it.
