uGet 1.7.3 (developing)

This version requires GTK+ version 2.18+

What's new since 1.7.2:
1. support for application indicator.
2. program can use absolute path to launch aria2c. 
3. fix building error.

What's new since 1.7.1:
1. add setting - "Always show tray icon".
2. add more setting, column, and view for aria2.
3. enable aria2 plug-in by default. (remove --enable-plugin-aria2)
4. add configure option "--with-gtk3" to enable GTK+3 support.
5. fix minor bugs.

What's new since 1.7.0:
For user:
1. Add scheduler.
2. Add new timestamp columns - "Added On" and "Completed On"
3. It can sort downloads by column in "All" category.
4. It can do speed limit control per download. (global speed control? not ready.)
5. It can handle HTTP header "Accept-Ranges:" and send message to notify resumable or not resumable.
6. The layout of main window was changed.

For developer:
A new aria2 plug-in. If you want to test it, run configure with --enable-plugin-aria2 --disable-plugin-curl
and run "aria2c --enable-xml-rpc" in commandline.
All related sourcecode place in uglib/UgXmlrpc.c, uglib/UgPlugin-aria2.c

-----------------------------
What's new since 1.6.x:
For user:
1. You can see new icons and "Active" subcategory.
2. It also can refresh progress more fast than 1.6.
3. Program will rename config directory from "Uget" to "uGet" automatically.
4. Program can change tray icon if an error occurred or downloading start.

For developer:
1. The UgCategory becomes a independent structure and removes watch and dispatch functions.
2. New UgRunning is a group contains all running jobs, all watch and dispatch functions move to here.
3. New UgDataLog is used for log. It only has two members currently.
4. I implement a simple average speed limit in ug_running_do_speed_limit(). I hope anyone can improve it.
